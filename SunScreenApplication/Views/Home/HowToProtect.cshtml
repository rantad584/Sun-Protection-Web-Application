    <h1>What to Wear?</h1>
</div>
<p>
    Choosing the right clothing for high UV weather can be confusing and sometimes dangerous! Did you know that you can be burnt through certain fabrics? However, clothing is still the best way to protect your skin from sun damage according to the skin cancer foundation (Skin Cancer Foundation, 2019).
</p>
<p>
    Clothing is rated with an Ultraviolet Protection factor (UPF) that demonstrates how protective it is from the sun. A garment with a UPF of 50 allows only 2% of the sun’s rays to impact your skin thus providing a substantial barrier to damage and without the need to reapply (Skin Cancer Foundation, 2019).
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: this differs from the Sun Protection Factor which measures the time for your UV exposed skin to burn. For example, if you use SPF 15 correctly you can stay in the sun 15 times longer than without the sunscreen before you burn (Skin Cancer Foundation, 2019). Additionally, SPF only relates to levels of UVB radiation while UPF relates to both UVA and UVB radiation. Please see here (hyper link on here) for more information about UVA and UVB!
</p>
<p>
    Here are some general rules you can use when deciding on if a garment will protect you or not (all information sourced from the Skin Cancer Foundation (2019)):
</p>
<p>
    - Colour: yes colour! Darker fabrics absorb more light than lighter ones thus offering you more protection.
</p>
<p>
    - Make and material: how densely woven a garment is and what its constructed with all help determine its UPF. For instance, lightweight linen shirts can be so breathable they allow the sun in while dense materials such as denim can offer complete sun protection. Additionally, tight fabrics are generall.y less sun protective than loose ones.
</p>
<p>
    - UPF: some garments such as rash guards and outdoor wear may provide UPF labels and inform you about how protective the clothing is.
</p>
<p>
    - Activity: be aware that when a garment is wet or manipulated by sport or other activity its protection can be reduced!
